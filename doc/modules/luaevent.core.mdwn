----
Constants:

* `LEAVE` - When returned will cause event callback to be cancelled
* `EV_READ`
	* Marks read readiness/event capture.
	* Read readiness can also mean that an 'accept' operation will succeed, or
	  a disconnection on the other end is detected (read will return nothing).
* `EV_WRITE`
	* Marks write readiness/event capture.
	* Can also mark the successful completion of a non-blocking connect
	  if `SO_ERROR`@`SOL_SOCKET` is zero.
* `EV_SIGNAL`
	* Marks signal received/event capture
* `EV_TIMEOUT`
	* Timeout occurred while waiting for an event
* `EV_PERSIST`
	* Marks an event as persistent and not one-shot
* `EV_*`
	* Can be OR'd together to capture multiple events that make sense.
	  (Should not OR `EV_READ`/`EV_WRITE` with `EV_SIGNAL`)
	* Can be received OR'd together.
	  For example: `EV_READ` | `EV_TIMEOUT` means that a timeout
	  occurred while waiting for a read event.
* `EVBUFFER_READ`
* `EVBUFFER_WRITE`
* `EVBUFFER_EOF`
* `EVBUFFER_ERROR`
* `EVBUFFER_TIMEOUT`
